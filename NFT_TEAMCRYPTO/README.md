// # NFT PROJECT TOOL USING: HARDHAT,OpenZeppelin,Alchemy,IPFS,PINATA etc.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
multiple time npm run command(in bash or git bash): 
for i in `seq 10`; do node scripts/mint-nft.js; done 
for i in {1..10}; do command; done

for powershall: for($i=1;$i -le 10;$i++) {command}
```
